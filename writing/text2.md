**Title: "The Unlikely Alliance"**

**Act One: The Uneasy Meeting**

Deep in the shadow of the Black Mountains, Dragorax the dragon glared at Sorina the witch and Eldrin the wizard. They stood in a tense circle, none happy about their forced alliance.

“Teaming up with a witch and wizard? Ridiculous,” Dragorax growled, smoke curling from his nostrils.

“I’d rather hex you both,” Sorina snapped, her fingers twitching near her staff.

Eldrin sighed. “The Shadow King’s power is growing. If we don’t unite, his darkness will consume us all.”

With reluctance, the three agreed to work together. Rumors of the Shadow King’s rise had brought them here—a dark sorcerer amassing power from the Underworld. Alone, none of them could stop him, but together, they might stand a chance.

**Act Two: Facing the Shadows**

The trio traveled to the heart of the Black Mountains, where the Shadow King’s fortress loomed, surrounded by shadowy creatures. Dragorax led the charge, his fire breath scorching the monsters that lurked in their path. Sorina summoned protective wards, while Eldrin blasted shadow creatures with light magic.

But as they reached the fortress gates, the Shadow King himself appeared, a towering figure cloaked in darkness. His voice echoed like a nightmare. “You dare challenge me? You will fall.”

The battle began, but the Shadow King was too powerful. His tendrils of darkness lashed out, driving them back. Eldrin attempted a banishing spell, but it fizzled against the dark magic. Sorina unleashed bolts of green lightning, but they vanished into the void. Even Dragorax’s flames were swallowed by the darkness.

“We can’t defeat him separately!” Eldrin shouted. “We need to combine our powers!”

Sorina hesitated. “You expect me to merge my magic with yours?”

“There’s no other way!” Eldrin yelled.

Dragorax roared, his golden eyes flaring. “Then let’s finish this.”

**Act Three: The Final Battle**

Eldrin raised his staff, channeling light magic. “Sorina, cast your spell alongside mine. We’ll create a barrier.”

Sorina nodded, raising her staff and chanting. The air crackled as their magics collided, forming a swirling shield of light and shadow.

Dragorax took to the sky. “I’ll strike from above.”

With the shield holding back the Shadow King’s attacks, Dragorax unleashed a torrent of fire from above. His flames, mixed with the barrier’s power, pierced through the Shadow King’s defenses. But it wasn’t enough to destroy him.

“Now!” Eldrin cried. He and Sorina funneled all their remaining energy into the shield, amplifying Dragorax’s fire. Together, their combined magic slammed into the Shadow King with a force so powerful it shattered the darkness. The Shadow King screamed and disintegrated, his evil wiped from existence.

The battlefield grew quiet. The dark clouds cleared, and the oppressive energy in the air lifted.

Dragorax landed, eyeing the witch and wizard. “You’re not as weak as I thought.”

Sorina smirked. “Same to you, dragon.”

Eldrin chuckled, wiping sweat from his brow. “We make a good team.”

Though still wary of one another, they shared a nod of understanding. They had triumphed, not as friends, but as an unlikely alliance.

And in the face of evil, that was enough.

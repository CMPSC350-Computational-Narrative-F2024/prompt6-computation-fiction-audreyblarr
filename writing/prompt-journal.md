As they bounce higher, they start swapping abilitiesâ€”Mushroom gains Giraffe's height, Elephant shrinks to Mushroom's size, and Giraffe develops super-strength. When the trampoline reveals its true purpose as a portal to an ancient realm where creatures must exchange traits to survive, the friends must navigate their bizarre transformations and work together to unlock the trampoline's final, reality-bending leap.""
